# OOP
1. Classes and instances
    * Everything is written in classes and uses instances of these classes
2. Encapsulation
    * Private properties and methods are prefixed with ```_``` underscore and are doc blocked.
3. Composition
    * Composition is favoured over inheritance and due to the complex nature of using P5 with Webpack and NPM,
    classes are more tied to their own methods and properties rather than depending on others.
4. Inheritance
    * The screen classes make use of inheritance
